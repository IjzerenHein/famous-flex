## Documentation

Please note that documentation (i.e. everything in the `docs` directory) is
**automatically generated**.  As such, contributions should be made to the
respective `.js` source file used to generate the final markdown.

e.g. `layouts/CollectionLayout.js` contains the source documentation
used to generate `docs/layouts/CollectionLayout.md`.  Only the former
should be modified.
